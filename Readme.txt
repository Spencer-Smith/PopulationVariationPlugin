-- Overview --

A Population Variation plug-in for the Skyline software program that 
can assist researchers in determining whether their target peptides 
have known mutations in the general human population.

-- Details --

In the context of clinical or population studies using targeted 
proteomics (MRM/SRM), a peptide with a high natural variation is 
problematic. Subjects with the minor allele have a different amino 
acid sequence. Therefore, the targeted approach of MRM/SRM which 
isolates a specific m/z would register a null or noise value for the 
peptide target, confounding downstream analysis.

The Population Variation plug-in for the Skyline software program can 
assist researchers in determining whether their target peptides have 
known mutations in the general human population. Three kinds of 
mutations that alter protein coding sequences are reported: non-
synonymous variants that change a single amino acid, and frame-shift 
and stop-gain mutations that alter all downstream amino acids.
